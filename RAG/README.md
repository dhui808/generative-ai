### Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
```
  A pattern that uses your data with an LLM to generate answers specific to your data.
```

### Index
```
  An index is a data store that allows you to search data efficiently. 

  An index can be optimized for LLMs by creating vectors (text data converted to number sequences using
  an embedding model).

  The Azure AI index uses Azure AI Search as the primary and recommended index store.

  Azure AI Search is an Azure resource that supports information retrieval over your vector and textual
  data stored in search indexes.
